        The LoA analysis is the best statistical method for assessing the agreement between two quantitative methods

        This method is developed to assess the methodological challenge of **non-constant agreement over time** when 
        there is a drift in the accuracy over time. Drift refers to the gradual shift in baseline values of the 
        measured physiological parameter over time. The accuracy could change over time, such as (I) sensor drift 
        (e.g. less accurate measurements of the device after the moment of calibration) and (II) patient drift 
        (e.g. movement, positioning, health status, or medication).
        
        Existing LoA analyses do not consider changes in accuracy and precision over time, which is why the 
        **longitudinal analysis** was created. The longitudinal analysis involves breaking down a dataset into smaller 
        parts over time and applying **existing LoA analysis** to each part. A moving time window is applied, and 
        based on the data included in the window, the bias and 95% LoA are calculated for each time window. 
        The classic, repeated measurements or mixed-effects LoA analysis calculates the bias and 95% LoA. 
        A constant agreement over the measurement range is assumed.
        
        The **agreement plot** was developed to visualisation the outcomes of the longitudinal analysis to provide 
        insight into the accuracy and precision over time. Figure 3 provides an example of the agreement plot. 
        The y-axis shows the differences between the two devices (similar to the Bland-Altman plot), while the x-axis 
        represents the start time of the window. The bias- and 95% LoA-lines indicate the accuracy and precision over 
        the time windows. The advantage of the agreement plot is that it facilitates the identification of trends or 
        patterns over time that may go unnoticed otherwise. Exploring the cause of changes is the subsequent step, 
        although this falls beyond the scope of this thesis.

        the histogram and Q-Q plot to ensure that 95% of paired measurements fall within the 95% LoA interval.
